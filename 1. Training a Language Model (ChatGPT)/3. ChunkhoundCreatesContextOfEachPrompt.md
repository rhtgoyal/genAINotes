# Chunkhound Creates Context of Each Prompt

This document explains the role of **Chunkhound** in Copilot and how it improves efficiency by creating context for each prompt.

---

## 🧩 What is Chunkhound?
- A framework used by Copilot to handle **large inputs** (like codebases, documents, or logs).
- It **splits** big files into smaller, manageable chunks.
- It **indexes** those chunks for fast retrieval.
- It **retrieves** only the relevant chunks when you ask a question.

## ⚙️ How Chunkhound Creates Context
1. **Chunking**
   - Breaks large files (like thousands of lines of code or a long document) into smaller sections that fit within the model’s context window.
   - Prevents token overflow and loss of detail: Each piece is small enough to fit into the model’s context window.

2. **Indexing**
   - Each chunk is tagged and stored so Copilot knows where to find it later.
   - Acts like a searchable library of pieces.

3. **Retrieval**
   - When you ask a question, Copilot doesn’t load the whole file.
   - Instead, it retrieves only the most relevant chunks and feeds them into the model.

4. **Context Creation**
   - Retrieved chunks are combined with the **system prompt** and **user prompt**.
   - This forms the **context window** for that specific answer.
   - The model then predicts tokens based on this curated context.

## 🎯 Why It Improves Efficiency
- **Saves tokens**: Only relevant chunks are used, not the entire file.
- **Improves accuracy**: Reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in the right context.
- **Scales better**: Handles very large projects or documents without hitting token limits.
- **Speeds up responses**: Faster than re‑feeding entire files each time.
